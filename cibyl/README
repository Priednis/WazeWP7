Cibyl is an environment to compile and run programs written in C,
Objective-C, C++ and possibly Fortran on J2ME phones. It is documented
on the project page at

  http://cibyl.org

and the source code can be found on github:

  http://github.com/SimonKagstrom/cibyl

Prerequisites
-------------
You need the following to use Cibyl:

- unzip, gcc, g++, tar, gzip, make, cmake
- Python (2.3, 2.4 tested)
- The Jasmin assembler (http://jasmin.sourceforge.net)
- A Java compiler / runtime environment
- The jasmin java assembler (http://jasmin.sourceforge.net)
- For J2ME support, MIDPath (http://midpath.thenesis.org) or the Sun
  Wireless Toolkit

Building Cibyl
--------------
To setup Cibyl, do the following steps:

1. Download a pre-built toolchain from http://cibyl.org. In this
    case you can skip directly to step 2.

   Alternatively, build it first using the following command:

     cd toolchain
     make # (this will take some hours)

2. Unpack the toolchain

     cp cibyl-bin-PLATFORM-VERSION.tar.bz2 /path/to/install/dir
     tar -xjf cibyl-bin-PLATFORM-VERSION.tar.bz2

3. Add the Cibyl binaries to your path:

     export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/install/dir/mips-cibyl-elf/bin

   If you downloaded the pre-built toolchain, you can stop here.

4. Build the translator and the cibyl libraries

     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake ../
     make && make install

   this will install the libraries and tools in /path/to/install/dir

5. Build the examples by e.g.,

     cd examples/host-java/hello-world
     make


6. To build a J2ME example, do

   6.1 For windows:

      cd examples/j2me/hello-world
      make -f Makefile.cygwin

   6.2 For other platforms:

      cd examples/j2me/hello-world
      make
