The Cibyl subversion archive contains code which is released under different
licsenses. The main license is the LGPL (see trunk/COPYING), but the tools are
released under plain GPL (trunk/tools/COPYING).

The reason is that I want the libraries ("syscalls") to be possible to link
with even for projects which does not release the source code.
