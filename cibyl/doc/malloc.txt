The malloc and free implementation (in libs/src/smalloc.c) was
implemented by Calin A. Culianu and  Mark B. Hanson (with a few
modifications by me). The copyright statement is below.

All files are Public Domain by Calin A. Culianu <calin@ajvar.org>, but a
lot of code was stolen from Mark B. Hanson's <mbh@panix.com> simple
malloc implementation available at
http://www.panix.com/~mbh/projects.html.
