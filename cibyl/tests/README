These are the Cibyl test cases and regression tests. If you find an
error in Cibyl, please add a test case here.

Expcected failures
------------------
Some of the floating point tests are expected to fail due to rounding
errors. This happens on the host as well and the problem is really
comparing exact values with floats.

- sinf(), sin(): Inexactness due to conversion (and in the double-case
  -0.0 vs 0.0)

- The file operations will fail unless you have and can access the
  file file:///root/a (which will be written, read and listed in the
  directory)

- Connector read+seek: The J2ME FileConnection/Connector file://
  protocol does not support the reset() operation
