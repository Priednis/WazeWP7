This example shows how to use Cibyl to export a C library to Java

It exports the library in c/lib/implementation.c which simply exports
three functions:

  int add_to_arg(int num)
  int *get_int_pointer(void)
  void update_pointer(int *p)

the file LibraryWrapper.java shows how the Java interface to these
works.
