Waze for Windows Phone is a port of waze BlackBerry version to Windows Phone environment. Both platforms share the same challenge in not supporting C/C++ code.
The work is based on a work made by Waze for converting their C code into Java for supporting BlackBerry. This project uses the same tools used for converting the C code into Java but contains the necessary changes for converting the C code into .NET CIL bytecode.
The main tool used for this conversion is Cibyl the originally converts C code to Java. The project contains altered Cibyl source code for producing .NET WIndows Phone assembly code instead of Java bytecode.
